Architecture: Monolith (Spring Boot only), no Kafka, introductions-based matching
Matching: 1-3 introductions per day, stored in PostgreSQL
UI: Anti-swipe, 1 card at a time, calm premium design

Files changed:

This is a complete refactoring to transform Chattr from a swipe-based
matchmaking app to an anti-swipe, values-based introductions platform.
